1. **What are the types of design patterns in Java?**

   | Design Pattern Type | Sub-type                                                     |
   | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | Creational          | Factory Pattern; Abstract Factory Pattern; Singleton Pattern; Prototype Pattern; Builder Pattern |
   | Structural          | Adapter Pattern; Bridge Pattern; Composite Pattern; Decorator Pattern; Facade Pattern; Flyweight Pattern; Proxy Pattern |
   | Behavioral          | Chain Of Responsibility Pattern; Command Pattern; Interpreter Pattern; Iterator Pattern; Mediator Pattern; Memento Pattern; Observer Pattern; State Pattern; Strategy Pattern; Template Pattern; Visitor Pattern |

   

2. **What are the SOLID Principles?**

   | SOLID Principles          | Description                                                  |
   | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | **S**ingle Responsibility | Each class should be responsible for a single part or functionality of the system. |
   | **O**pen-Closed           | Software components should be open for extension, but not for modification. |
   | **L**iskov Substitution   | Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the system. |
   | **I**nterface Segregation | No client should be forced to depend on methods that it does not use. |
   | **D**ependency Inversion  | High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, both should depend on abstractions. |

   

3. **How can you achieve thread-safe singleton patterns in Java?**

   We can use synchronized block inside the if loop and volatile variable, as shown below.

   ```java
   public class Singleton {
       private Singleton() {}
       private static volatile Singleton instance;
       public static Singleton getInstance() {
         if(instance == null) {
               synchronized (Singleton.class) {
                   if (instance == null) {
                       instance = new Singleton();
                  } 			
               }
   				}
           return instance;
       }
   }
   ```

   

4. **What do you understand by the Open-Closed Principle (OCP)?**

   The code should be written in a way that new functionality can be added without changing the existing code. The change to one of the classes don't affect other depending classes. In a nutshell, the developer must need to change only a specific part of the code (a class or a function) every time a requirement changes. The open/closed principle is generally achieved by using **inheritance** and **polymorphism**.
